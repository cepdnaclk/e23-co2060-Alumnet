# Alumnet: Alumni-Student Engagement Platform

> A centralized, university-managed digital platform designed to bridge the gap between students and alumni.

---

## 📢 Project Overview
Universities face challenges in maintaining meaningful engagement with alumni, often relying on fragmented platforms like social media and email. **Alumnet** solves this by providing a secure, role-based environment for:
1.  **Connecting:** A searchable directory to identify alumni by academic background or expertise.
2.  **Mentoring:** A structured workflow for students to request guidance and for alumni to manage these requests.
3.  **Engaging:** A central hub for university events and engagement monitoring.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Alumni Directory:** Searchable database filtering by batch, department, and skills.
* **Mentorship Workflow:** Structured system where students send requests and alumni can Accept/Reject.
* **Event Announcements:** Administrators can broadcast events to all users (no ticketing/payments involved).
* **Role-Based Access:** Secure dashboards for Students, Alumni, and Administrators.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Tools for user approval, role management, and engagement analytics.
